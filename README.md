Pretext: I'm a High School student learning web design through The Odin Project. This will be my first functional website and first project of The Odin Project, where I aim to create a recipes website demonstrating my knowledge over HTML specifically through formatting, linking, images, and structure. 

Conventionally, I'm sure this would be done through cooked foods and baked goods. Personally, I don't cook, so instead I'll be relying on sweets and coffee, each of which I <em>do</em> know how to cook.

Thanks for stopping by!

Reflection: *do when done\*
