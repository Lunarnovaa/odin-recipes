Pretext: I'm a High School student learning web design through The Odin Project. This will be my first functional website and first project of The Odin Project, where I aim to create a recipes website demonstrating my knowledge over HTML specifically through formatting, linking, images, and structure. 

Conventionally, I'm sure this would be done through cooked foods and baked goods. Personally, I don't cook, so instead I'll be relying on sweets and coffee, each of which I <em>do</em> know how to cook.

Thanks for stopping by :)

Reflection: This was a pretty fun project honestly. I got to practice all my coding, exhibit some personally, and learn
git. That last part was definitely what was the most important to me. Git is a powerful tool, and I feel like I've had
a lot of great practice today. I kinda wish I used the emphasize and strong formatting options a bit more, but I used
them as much as I felt fit.

Overall, a great first experience :)
