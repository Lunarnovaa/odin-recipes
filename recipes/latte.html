    <h3>Learn to make one of these :)</h2>
    <p>
        When I was growing up, I had a number of fascinating experiences to do with lattes, which I'll be telling you all about. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Just kidding.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe will explain to you how to make a yummy latte, easily and cheaply. It'll be a beginners guide,
        so I'll be assuming you don't want to grind your own beans or invest much money into it.
    </p>
    <h2>What you'll need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Home-ground or store-bought coffee grinds (finer is better)</li>
        <li>A Moka Pot (an Aeropress would also work but look elsewhere for instructions.)</li>
        <li>A microwave</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>A milk frothier or a whisk</li>
        <li>Cup and tablespoon measuring cups</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure a little less than 1/2 cup of water.</li>
        <li>Measure out 3-4 tablespoons of coffee grounds.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Experiment a little!</li>
                <li>Different people like different strength coffee.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>In the bottom section of the Moka Pot, pour your water in.</li>
        <li>In the middle funnel-like section, pour your coffee grounds in.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Be careful not to spill!</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Screw it all together and place in on a burner roughly the size of the base of the Moka Pot.</li>
        <li>While you're waiting, measure out somewhere between 1/2 to 1 cup of milk.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Again, its good to experiment.</li>
                <li>If you're unsure of how much you want, measure more and taste your coffee before adding too much.</li>
                <li>And remember, you can always make more later or the next day :)</li>
            </ul>
        <li><em>Important: Make sure the milk is in a container with an open top that can fit over double the volume!</em></li>
        <li>Whisk/froth the milk until the volume has doubled.</li>
        <li>Microwave the frothed milk in 15-30 second increments, stirring between.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Note: The volume will increase as its heated.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Once the Moka Pot is steaming (should take around 8-10 minutes), take it away from heat and stir the contents.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is because the coffee brewed at the start is stronger than the stuff brewed near the end.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Pour the coffee in a mug, and add how much milk you want.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The coffee you just brewed is <strong>super strong,</strong> (it's supposed to be closer to espresso), so be generous with the milk. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add the extra froth on top and enjoy!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You can additionally add sugar or syrup to it, if thats what you like.</li>
            </ul>
