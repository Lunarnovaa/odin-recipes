        Look. Lattes are great. But there's a certain feeling standard coffee will give you that nothing can quite 
        match. I know that, and you know that. So here's my brewing recipe for coffee, too.
    </p>
    <p>
        This one's gonna be a little less in depth than the other one. Also I don't steam my milk for standard coffee---
        it's kinda supposed to be a lower effort thing, plus it doesn't matter as much because the milk affects the
        temperature less.

        Anyways, let's get into it. Get your nostrils ready for that perfect coffee smell :)

    <h2>Things you'll need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A coffee pot (I'll be supplying instructions for a Moka Pot, as that's what I have.)</li>
        <li>Home-ground or pre-bought coffee grinds</li>
        <li>Measuring cups</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure out 2 cups of water.</li>
            <ul>
                <il>This will be roughly how much coffee you'll be making.</il>
                <il>If 2 cups is too much, you can use less--- just be sure to preserve the ratios between
                    water and coffee grounds.</il>
            </ul>
        <li>Measure out 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds.</li>
        <li>In the bottom section of the Moka Pot, pour your water in.</li>
        <li>In the middle funnel-like section, pour your coffee grounds in.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Be careful not to spill any!</li>
                <li>Additionally, be sure not to have the pile be "heaping." It should be flush.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Screw it all together and place in on a burner roughly the size of the base of the Moka Pot.</li>
        <li>Once the Moka Pot is steaming (should take around 8-10 minutes), take it away from heat and stir the contents.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is because the coffee brewed at the start is stronger than the stuff brewed near the end.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Pour the coffee in a mug, and add how much milk you want.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember you can always add more, but you can't take away :)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add sugar or syrup to it if you want!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I personally like to add vanilla syrup. You can buy it at the store.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
